## VISIBILITY NOTE

Library Assets are only visible for applications that have a published store page on Steam. If your store page is not published, Library Assets will not be visible in the Steam client.

## REQUIRED ASSETS

### 1. LIBRARY CAPSULE (Required)

- **Design Requirements:**
  - Graphically-centric image giving users a sense of the experience
  - Use key art and logo from retail boxes or marketing
  - Include game logo that is easily legible against the background
  - Do NOT include quotes or text beyond the title of your game

### 2. LIBRARY HEADER (Required)
- **Size:** 920px x 430px

  - Do NOT include quotes or text beyond the title of your game

### 3. LIBRARY HERO (Required)
- **Size:** 3840px x 1240px (system auto-generates 1920px x 620px version)
- **Usage:** Appears at the top of a user's library details page
- **Design Requirements:**

  - Cannot include ANY text
  - Central "safe area" of 860px x 380px remains uncropped when Steam client window is resized
  - Critical content should be within the safe area
  - Artwork should extend across the entire template

### 4. LIBRARY LOGO (Required)
- **Size:** Either 1280px wide and/or 720px tall (system auto-generates half-size version)
- **Usage:** Appears on top of hero graphic on library details page

  - No words other than your game's title
  - After upload, you'll need to select logo position: left bottom corner, centered top, centered middle, or centered bottom

## NOTE ON HERO AND LOGO DISPLAY

The hero graphic and logo are layered and move independently when the page is scrolled, creating a subtle parallax effect. Consider how the product logo will be placed on top of the hero image to ensure visibility and legibility.

If hero graphic and logo are not uploaded, the hero area will display a screenshot from the store with the application name text overlaid in the bottom left corner.

- No review scores
