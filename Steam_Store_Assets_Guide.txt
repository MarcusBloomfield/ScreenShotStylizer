## NOTE ON HERO AND LOGO DISPLAY

The hero graphic and logo are layered and move independently when the page is scrolled, creating a subtle parallax effect. Consider how the product logo will be placed on top of the hero image to ensure visibility and legibility.

If hero graphic and logo are not uploaded, the hero area will display a screenshot from the store with the application name text overlaid in the bottom left corner.
