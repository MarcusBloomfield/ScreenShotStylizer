# STEAM GRAPHICAL ASSET RULES
## Based on: https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/assets/rules

This document summarizes Steam's rules for graphical assets, which went into effect September 1, 2022.

## STORE GRAPHICAL ASSET RULES

Store graphical assets are the banner images (called 'Capsules' in Steamworks) that represent your game throughout the store.

1. Content on base graphical asset capsules is limited to game artwork, the game name, and any official subtitle. This means:
   - **NO review scores** of any kind, including Steam reviews or external sources
   - **NO award names, symbols, or logos**
   - **NO discount marketing copy** (e.g., "On Sale Now" or "Up to 90% off")
   - **NO text or imagery promoting a different product** (no marketing of sequels or other titles)
   - **NO other miscellaneous text**

2. For promoting updates and seasonal events, Valve allows limited text via Artwork Overrides:
   - **Must use Artwork Overrides** with a length limit of one month
   - **Must localize any text** into at least the same languages supported by the game
   - **Only to describe new content** - Acceptable additional text is limited to describing:
     - Major updates to game content
     - New seasonal events
     - Battle passes
     - DLC
     - Similar new content for the game

## LIBRARY GRAPHICAL ASSET RULES

Library graphical assets represent your game within the Steam library and consist of:

1. **Library Capsule**
   - Must include your game logo
   - Can include your game's subtitle if appropriate
   - No other text should be present

2. **Library Hero**
   - Should only contain artwork
   - There should be no words at all in this asset

3. **Library Logo**
   - Only your game's logotype (title in special font/lettering)
   - Optionally a logomark (icon that stands alongside your game's title)
   - Must be on a transparent background
   - No other words besides your game's logotype

## GENERAL GRAPHICAL ASSET RULES

All capsules everywhere on Steam must adhere to these basic rules:

1. Capsule images must contain a readable product logo/name and have accurate dimensions
2. All capsule images (store and library) must have PG-13 appropriate artwork

## APPROPRIATE TEXT USAGE EXAMPLE

Tastefully promoting your recent update or new content is acceptable on store capsules, only if:
- You use a Temporary Artwork Override
- You localize the text into languages supported by your game

## STORE PAGE ACCOLADES

Steam provides dedicated spaces on game store pages to present:
- Press review quotes
- Press review scores
- Special awards

These should be used instead of putting such information on capsule images. See the Store Page Accolades documentation for details.

## ENFORCEMENT

- These rules went into effect September 1, 2022
- Games not adhering to these rules may have limited visibility within the Steam store
- Non-compliant games will be ineligible for featuring in official Steam sales and events

Developers should review their graphical assets by visiting 'edit store' for their game and clicking the 'graphical assets' tab. Remember to check for any active Artwork Overrides that might need updating.
