# ScreenShot Stylizer - Long Term Memory

## Project Description
ScreenShot Stylizer is an AI-powered web application that allows users to upload images and stylize them using OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision and DALL-E models. The application features a chat interface for describing style preferences and provides image history navigation.

## Key Components

### Frontend Components
- ImageUploader.tsx: Handles drag and drop image uploads
- ChatFeed.tsx: Manages the chat conversation interface
- ImageDisplay.tsx: Displays images and provides navigation controls

### Backend Components
- imageController.ts: Handles image upload and processing requests
- openaiService.ts: Integrates with OpenAI API for image stylization
- imageRoutes.ts: Defines API endpoints for image operations

### State Management
- useImageStyler.ts: Custom hook that manages application state and operations

## Feature Notes
- Image uploads are limited to 10MB maximum
- Supported image formats include PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, and WEBP
- Images are processed through OpenAI's DALL-E 3 model
- Conversations are handled through OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision model
- Image transformations are saved in the backend/uploads/images directory
- Previous image versions can be navigated with the UI controls

## Development Workflow
1. Frontend runs on default webpack port (8080)
2. Backend runs on port 3001
3. Both can be started concurrently with "npm run dev"
4. OpenAI API key is required and stored in backend/.env

## Important Locations
- Uploaded images: backend/uploads/images
- Temporary files: backend/uploads/temp
- OpenAI service: backend/src/services/openaiService.ts
- Image endpoints: backend/src/routes/imageRoutes.ts
